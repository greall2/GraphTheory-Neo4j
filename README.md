# GraphTheory-Neo4j

### Introduction:
As Part of my Graph Theory Module we were required to create a Timetable Database using Neo4j. I created group C’s semester one timetable, for Software Development, Year 3 in GMIT using the query language Cypher. 


### Neo4j:
Neo4j is one of the World’s leading Graph Databases. Neo4j is an open-source NoSQL graph database implemented in Java and Scala. Neo4j is a highly scalable graph database. This Graph database focuses on the relationships between data as well as the data itself.


“No broken links” is the main rule behind graph databases. This states that you cannot delete a node without also deleting the relationships associated with these nodes. This is because a relationship always has a start and an end node.


Cypher is the query language used in Neo4j for expressive and efficient querying and updating of the graph store. Cypher is a declarative language, meaning what you want to retrieve can be seen in the query expression. Unlike Java and other scripting languages, Cypher focuses on the clarity of expressing what to retrieve from a graph and not how to retrieve it.
